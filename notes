#1 security is most important
under security, the most important thing is the protection of the user password
for security, i chose django and react because of the tools the mature django has for security and the way react
loads the document reduces the chance cross site scripting attacks
as well for security, i validated every input and used a password field for the password



react and django
mongo (doens't matter)
